    <h2>Work progression</h2>
    <p>
      In late 2018, I started working at <a href="https://www.theloop.pt">TheLoopCo</a> as one of the first tech hires.
      Since there were limited people, I had the chance to work/explore the entire stack, from building frontends and backends
      to managing CI pipelines and Kubernetes clusters.
      And as knowledge stacked up, had the chance to advise other teams and mentor other members.
    </p>

    <p>
      At some point, I felt it was time to change. So in 2021, I decided to join another startup <a href="https://maven.pet">Maven</a>.
      I wanted to experience remote work and be involved in a product centric company with a more experienced team.
      Once again, the team is small and a bit of everything has to be done.

    <h2>Motivations</h2>
    <p>
      My best work is done when independence, ownership and impact is valued and encoraged.
      I enjoy a good challenge like fixing a difficult bug, diving into unknown code or systems and finding ways to prevent the
      issue from happening again or at least reduce friction. Although I have worked across the stack my favorite area is backend.
