Welcome to my personal blog :)

This blog is about me, particularly my crazy life experiments to achieve productivity, reduce addictions and try to be happier overall.

At this date, the blog is in its most basic state. Hope to bring new features in the futures to connect with you, get your opinions or suggestions and hopefully engage in interesting debates.

The blog will receive content soon, so I will be me more than glad to have you back in a week.
