When I was a little monkey, about 8 months old, in one of my first quests to learn something new, something tragic happened. In my attempts to grasp the skill of walking, I walked away out of sight of whoever was supervising me. I saw a small stair step and thought it could be a great challenge. In fact, it was, but I was not yet up to the challenge. As a result, I fell, face right against the floor and broke my nose. It was not very severe aesthetically but it gave me a hard time breathing throw my nose.

Time went by until we reach this year, I'm 21 and will finally get it fixed.
The surgery went well and only had to face recovery. I do emphasize the "only" because the challenges were not the ones I expected.

To keep my nose in place, I had a cast that covered my nose, cheeks, and forehead, in a sort of x shape. I expected the pain to be the greatest challenge but with the help of painkillers and a lot of rest, it was easily manageable.

I stayed home for 2 weeks. In the first week, I was still under the side effects of anesthesia and had some fever, which resulted in me not really paying attention to what was around me. Then week two arrived and my head was clear, and with that, a great challenge arrived.

Because of the shape of the cast and the nose stitches, I couldn't smile or I would hurt my self and start bleeding. To give a bit of perspective of how a big of a deal this was, I have to state that I am I really happy dude, since I was young I smile all the time when I am nervous, scared, angry, happy or even for no reason at all. Adding to this, my brother and I love to troll our parents, plus they have some stupid reactions.

I attempted to have dinner with my family but had to leave or else I would smile. To aggravate the situation, I had been isolated for 1 week, my emotions were all over the place. As I advanced throw the week, the intensity of my emotion continued to increase. I realized I couldn't do most of the things that made me happy.

At the end of the week, I attempted, once again to dine with my family, and once again, I had to leave. But this time it was really severe. In my attempts to suppress my emotions, my body gave up mentally and had to express emotions in a different way. So instead of smiling, I started crying.

This event astonished me and made me think of what emotions really are, and how they can morph into the opposite. Also, it made me realized how happy I really was and how valuable smiling is to me.
