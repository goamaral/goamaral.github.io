title: The journey to happiness

During my late teens (high school and the first year of university), I struggled with deep depressive moments and accompanied some close friends passing through the same kind of problem. Was a rough period ... but I am conscious it's a phenomenon that is increasingly recurrent nowadays, especially in teens. Is a state of transition to adulthood that most of us aren't ready for.

In an attempt to surpass this phase, I tried to understand what were the underlying causes. What has changed since my early simple, happy middle school years?

In my journey, I discovered that, as a young introverted male, I lacked knowledge and intuition in areas related to soft skills. School and natural curiosity were great to acquire intellectual skills but as we grow up, relationships with ourselves and others get more complex.

From masculinity, life's purpose, religion, society, relationships with lovers and friends, goals, dreams, mindfulness and many more. I intend to explore this subjects in the future. I hope I will be able to set someone's life back on track or simply improve it.

I would love to hear your opinions, will try to set up a social account to talk with you as soon as possible.

Happiness is our right but we must work on it like it is our duty.
